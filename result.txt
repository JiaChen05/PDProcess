010416	I sat next to a Costco buyer%on a long flight%not that long ago%, and had- an intriguing conversation%.
010417	The first one%is that the data%should be as raw as possible%.
010418	When the bank/called the company%to check on the legitimacy/of the transactions%, they were chastised%.

010433	The other issue/everyone expects/the authority to solve/is that%of- a firm opening day%.
010434	While specialty mattresses/are on the downswing%, innerspring mattresses/are on the upswing%.
010435	But that job%came to a halt%as the nor easter approached%and- officials ordered people off the island- again%.
010436	Such overwhelming support/for memory foam beds would seem to augur well/for their success on the sales floor%.
